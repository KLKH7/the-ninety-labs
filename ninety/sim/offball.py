"""Off-the-ball decisions: where players go when they do not have the ball.

Each is an intention with the trigger the research describes, chosen from what the player
believes, never an outcome: a keeper narrows the angle and comes out to an attacker through on
goal; defenders mark the attackers who threaten the goal; team-mates of the ball carrier offer
support and make runs in behind when the carrier can play them. Docs: docs/ENGINE.md layer 6,
