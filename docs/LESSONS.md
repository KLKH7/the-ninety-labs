# Lessons

Mistakes this project has already made, so no tool or person makes them twice. Read it before
every task. Each lesson says what went wrong, the rule now, and how to check you are not
repeating it.

**When you catch a mistake, add a lesson here in the same pull request as the fix.** Keep it
short and actionable. This file is public: no research sources, product names or strategy.

## Simulation: results must emerge

### 1. Never script a result
- **What happened:** the match engine decided outcomes and then arranged the world to match: a
  pass was rolled "completed" or "intercepted" at the kick and the interceptor told where to
  stand; a saved shot was aimed at the keeper; a tackle succeeded on a dice roll; "on target"
  was read from where the shot was aimed. It passed every check without being football.
- **Rule:** model the cause (a kick with a velocity, players who react and reach the ball, a
  foot that meets the ball between touches) and let the outcome be observed. Event fields
  (outcome, receiver, end point) are filled from what happened, never from intention.
- **Check:** for every outcome, ask "where in the code is this decided?" If the answer is a
  random draw or a target, it is scripted.

### 2. Never tailor a number to a check
- **What happened:** engine constants sat just under the validator's limits (a tackle distance
  equal to the "ball at feet" limit; a keeper reach just under the hands limit).
- **Rule:** a threshold comes from a cited source or from measurement precision, set before
  looking at the engine's numbers. Never loosen a check or add an exemption to turn it green.
  Calibrating a physical parameter is allowed only within its sourced range.
- **Check:** every constant has a source or a "verify" note in `docs/GROUNDING.md`.

### 3. When removing a script makes things worse, add the missing cause
- **What happened:** honest contact physics dropped goals to zero and restarts to almost none.
  The scripts had been propping up the numbers.
- **Rule:** do not put the script back. Find the missing mechanism (decisions: shooting,
  crossing, clearing, going long) and add it.
- **Check:** realism is judged on several held-out patterns at once (passes, shots, restarts,
  ball-in-play time, pass length), never on the one number being chased.

### 4. The author is the worst auditor of their own scripting
- **What happened:** after "fixing" the engine, an independent audit found 21 more scripted or
  unrealistic shortcuts the author had missed.
- **Rule:** every engine change gets an independent review (a separate agent or person, given
  the code and the rule, not the author's reasoning) before it merges.

### 5. A hard clamp on position is a teleport
- **What happened:** a wall at the touchline stopped players dead; overlapping players were
  pushed apart in one frame. Both broke the acceleration check.
- **Rule:** change position only through velocity, within acceleration limits. Bodies avoid
  each other ahead of time and brace on contact.

### 6. Update order hides state gaps
- **What happened:** a player froze for exactly one frame when winning the ball, because the
  carrier was skipped in the general movement step and only moved by the carrier step from the
  next frame.
- **Rule:** in each tick, every entity is moved exactly once. Track who has already moved.

### 7. Judge a touch on the ball as it arrived
- **What happened:** "was this shot heading on target?" was computed after the deflection had
  already changed the ball's velocity.
- **Rule:** read the state for any judgement before mutating it.

## Checks that prove something

### 8. A check must be able to fail
- **Rule:** every validator check has a test that plants a defect and requires it to fail, and
  every legal case (a kick-off reset, a lofted pass, a substitution at a stoppage) has a test
  that requires it to pass, so no check is stricter than the Laws.
- **What happened:** a planted "ball never arrives" defect showed the ball-path check could
  never fail on short clips. Later, a new braking test stayed green with the braking limit set
  to infinity: an independent reviewer found it by breaking the limit on purpose.
- **Check (mutation test):** for every new check or test, break the thing it guards (set the
  limit to infinity, remove the line) and confirm exactly the intended test goes red; then
  restore and confirm green.

### 9. Passing the validator is not being realistic
- **What happened:** a run where every pass was intercepted met the data contract.
- **Rule:** the validator checks that football is possible; realism is a separate layer of
  pattern checks (`docs/GROUNDING.md`, R rows).

### 10. Margins come from physics and precision, not taste
- **What happened:** the gravity check ignored air drag, and its margin was smaller than the
  rounding error of positions stored to 1 mm (up to 1.25 m/s² on a second difference at 25 fps).
- **Rule:** derive every tolerance and write the derivation next to it.

### 11. Measure both kinds of error
- **What happened:** the first fact-checker judge caught every false claim but also rejected
  18 of 48 true ones, because it treated commentary ("a crucial intervention") as a false fact.
- **Rule:** an evaluation reports misses and false rejections, tunes on one seed and is
  confirmed on a held-out one.

## Working in the repo

### 12. "No checks yet" is not "checks passed"
- **What happened:** a pull request was merged before CI had started on its last commit,
  because the wait loop treated an empty check list as finished.
- **Rule:** wait until every required check has reported, then merge.

### 13. Keep diffs to what you meant to change
- **What happened:** a one-word schema change rewrote 131 lines because a tool reformatted the
  whole file.
- **Rule:** edit the line; check `git diff --stat` before committing.

### 14. Look at the rendered result
- **What happened:** an architecture diagram looked fine as source but GitHub cut it off at a
  fixed height; the next version was too small to read.
- **Rule:** open the rendered page after pushing any diagram.

### 15. A pipeline's exit code is its last command's
- **What happened:** a secret scan written as `grep ... | head; echo $?` reported success, but
  `$?` was `head`'s exit code, so it would have said the same whether or not anything matched.
- **Rule:** test the command whose answer you need on its own (`grep -c`, then its exit code),
  and add a positive control: something you know is there must be found.

### 18. Run the commands you document
- **What happened:** the data contract told readers to run `ninety-sim` without `--out`, which
  the CLI requires, so the first command a newcomer copied failed.
- **Rule:** every command in a doc is copied from a run that worked, with all required
  arguments.
- **Check:** paste each documented command into a fresh shell before merging.

### 21. Evidence has to fit in an agent's context
- **What happened:** frame-based stats cited every frame they used, so one 90-minute match
  produced 85 MB of facts (9.3 million source ids), too large for any agent or fact-checker.
- **Rule:** cite frames as a range (`frames:<first>-<last>`); cite events by id; a value of zero
  cites nothing.
- **Check:** a test requires frame-based facts to cite one range, and caps the size of a clip's facts.

## Data and grounding

### 16. Read the primary source
- **What happened:** "well-known" Laws in a draft were wrong or incomplete (throw-in distance,
  goal-kick position, corner distance, which Law covers switching ends).
- **Rule:** check each rule against the current Laws of the Game; implement it in our own
  words; never commit the Laws' text.

### 17. The ground truth is the answer key
- **Rule:** ground truth is used only for training labels and scoring. Nothing on the live path
  reads it. Whatever makes the video must also write the truth, so no generative video.

### 19. Persisted replay prompts are an interface
- **What happened:** making a rejection reason more specific changed the Analyst retry prompt,
  so an existing recorded slice stopped replaying even though the workflow behavior was valid.
- **Rule:** re-record the replay in the same pull request as any change to text that reaches a
  recorded prompt (fact-checker reasons, agent instructions). Never make the replayer tolerate a
  changed prompt: a shim that rewrites new wording back to old pairs an old answer with a new
  question.
- **Check:** run the committed replay fixture after changing fact-checker diagnostics.

### 20. One clock for viewers and agents
- **What happened:** agent-facing minute and second values were rounded and combined differently
  from the scorebug's floored elapsed clock, producing off-by-one timestamps and occasional
  second 60 values.
- **Rule:** build the displayed clock in one shared function, and keep football's ordinal minute
  as a separate field.
- **Check:** compare every compact event's clock and seconds with the scorebug clock at its event
  timestamp, including fractional seconds near a minute boundary.

### 22. An evaluation's true labels must be true, and must not be quoted in the prompt
- **What happened:** the fact-checker evaluation put "cautious" on every completed pass,
  including one of 42 m at 96 km/h, and labelled the claim true; the Judge rejecting it was
  counted as an error. The tone words being tested were also listed in the Judge's own
  instructions, so a good score partly measured the quote.
- **Rule:** attach a descriptive word only to events whose fields fit it, with the condition
  written before reading any model output; test generalisation on words the prompt never uses.
- **Check:** `tests/test_judge.py` fails if an evaluated tone word appears in the instructions,
  or a tone claim is built on an event outside its condition.


### 23. A graphic's words must follow the outcome, not just its numbers
- **What happened:** the first template graphics wrote "h10 finds h6" for every pass with a
  receiver, including the 10 failed passes in seed 7's first five minutes. The fact-checker's
  code half passed them, because it checks numbers and player ids, not verbs. The Ledger also
  dropped any fact source id it could not find, so a fact citing a missing event would have been
  stored with less evidence instead of failing.
- **Rule:** a word that states a result ("finds", "scores", "blocked") comes from the event's
  `outcome` field. A citation that does not resolve is an error, never filtered out.
- **Check:** `tests/test_cues.py::test_failed_pass_never_says_it_found_the_receiver` and
  `tests/test_ledger.py::test_load_match_refuses_a_fact_citing_a_missing_event` fail on the
  original code.
