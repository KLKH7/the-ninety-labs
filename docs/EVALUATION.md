# Evaluation

How every number in the README is produced. A number is published only when the command below
generated it and the output file is committed. Rows marked *planned* have no result yet.

| Measure | Command | Output | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simulator realism (passes, shots, tackles, pass completion per match) | `uv run pytest tests/test_sim.py` | test assertions | running |
| Event and frame schema validity | CI `smoke` job | CI log | running |
| Ground-truth data meets the data contract (consistency and physics) | `uv run ninety-validate <clip>` | command output | running: the engine meets the contract on full matches (seeds 7, 11, 21); CI runs it on the smoke clip |
| Render checks (projection error, label completeness, determinism, ball occlusion share) | `uv run ninety-render-check <clips> --determinism --report docs/eval/render-checks.json`; CI `render` job on every push | `docs/eval/render-checks.json`, CI log | running |
| Off-the-shelf detector recall on renders (guide check 2) | planned | `docs/eval/render-checks.json` | planned |
| Detection recall (players, ball) on the fixed test set | planned | `docs/eval/vision-report-v{n}.json` | planned |
| Event precision, recall and F1 per type; possession accuracy; speed error | planned | `docs/eval/vision-report-v{n}.json` | planned |
| Targeted data rounds, before and after | planned | `docs/eval/vision-report-v{n}.json` | planned |
| Stats engine facts: hand-computed cases, planted defects, citations, size | `uv run pytest tests/test_stats.py` | test assertions | running |
| Fact-checker rules (numbers, players, evidence ids) | `uv run pytest tests/test_factcheck.py` | test assertions | running |
| Ledger versioning, evidence validation, and deterministic cue fixture | `uv run pytest tests/test_ledger.py tests/test_cues.py` | `tests/fixtures/cues-seed7.jsonl` and test assertions | running: 10 tests; 152 cues for seed 7, five minutes |
| Fact-checker catch rate on planted false claims, and true claims wrongly rejected | `uv run python -m ninety.eval.factcheck_eval` | `docs/eval/fact-checker.md` | running (v0, templated claims on simulator events): 64/64 caught, 0/48 wrongly rejected |
| Recovery from injected failures | planned | `docs/eval/failure-table.md` | planned |
| Ablation: one agent against the full workflow | planned | `docs/eval/ablation.md` | planned |
| Latency to graphic and to speech (p50, p95); cost per match | planned | `docs/eval/latency-cost.md` | planned |

## Synthetic data

Why we generate data this way: [decision 0001](decisions/0001-synthetic-data.md). The clip and
its labels come from one command; the checks below read only the saved files.

```bash
uv run ninety-dataset --split test --seconds 10          # the fixed 5-clip test set, seeds 900001-900005
uv run ninety-render-check runs/dataset/test/seed9000* --determinism --report docs/eval/render-checks.json
```

| Check | How it is computed | Bar |
|---|---|---|
| Projection | the ball centre, projected through the saved `P`, against the centroid of the ball's drawn pixels; keypoints re-projected through `P`; each player's foot point against their pixel box | under 1 px; every foot inside its box |
| Label completeness | every frame has an image, a camera, 22 players and the ball; every drawn object has a box; no box on an undrawn one | no problems |
| Ball occlusion | share of frames with the ball in shot where its visibility is under 0.5 | above zero |
| Determinism | re-render the first clip; compare `frames.jsonl`, `events.jsonl` and image hashes | identical |
| Split integrity | `ninety/render/splits.py`: test seeds are reserved; overrides are refused on the test set | unit tests |

## Rules

- **The test set is fixed and separate.** Clips used to score detection are never used to train it,
  and targeted data rounds never add clips to the test set.
- **Every report records its inputs:** git commit, seeds, model versions and the date.
- **Results are reproducible:** each command runs from a clean clone after `uv sync`.
